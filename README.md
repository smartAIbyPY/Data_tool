# Data Tool - Data Exploration & Preprocessing CLI

---

## Description

`data_tool` is a cli tool which helped me simplify initial visualisation, analysis, and preprocessing datasets. With this tool, you can quickly inspect your data, clean it up, visualize trends, and prepare it for machine learning however it is clunky and essentially only a personal project/documentating my learning progress.
